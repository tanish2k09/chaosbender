A personal use sound effects discord bot for my server

Usage:

Make sure you have your MongoDB instance set up.
Use creds-template.json to create a creds.json file and fill in the required information.
Pass the path to your creds.json file as the first cmdline argument while executing.
If done correctly, the bot instance should be up and running.
